## Mobile Money Transaction Analysis
In this project, I delved into the world of financial transactions, analyzing a dataset of mobile money transactions provided by a financial services provider. My main objectives were to explore the dataset, identify patterns, especially in relation to fraud, and visualize the data for better understanding and presentation.

- **Skills Developed**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Open Source Tools, Presentation

## Spam or Ham? Building an Email Classifier
My task in this project was to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). This project was an insightful journey into the intricacies of email security and machine learning, providing me with a hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

- **Skills Developed**: Text-based ML Models, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Email Security Fundamentals

## Design and Develop a System to Tighten Access to Sensitive Information
In this module, I designed a system to manage user roles efficiently, ensuring that users have only the minimal set of roles required, thereby adhering to the principle of least privilege. This project was crucial for understanding access control systems and their significance in securing sensitive information.

- **Skills Developed**: Access Control, Application Security Hygiene, Data Structures, Web Application Development

## Skills Acquired
Through these projects, I have honed my skills in various domains, including but not limited to:

- Access Control and Application Security Hygiene
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Email Security Fundamentals
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
- Machine Learning, specifically Text-Based Models
- Open Source Tools and Technologies
- Presentation and Communication Skills
- Web Application Development
