# Project Summary

## Background
In this project, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider. The dataset includes five types of transactions: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER. Additionally, it contains fields for fraud detection, with `IsFlaggedFraud` indicating fraud detected by an automation system, and `IsFraud` indicating actual occurrences of fraud.

## Objective
My main goal in this project was to explore and visualize the financial payment services dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns, particularly in relation to fraud detection. This exploration is crucial for identifying areas that may need additional security measures or adjustments in transaction handling.

## Task Breakdown
### 1. Set Up
- I prepared my development environment by installing the necessary tools, libraries, and dependencies.
- I downloaded and accessed the project's code and dataset.

### 2. Data Exploration and Visualization
- I utilized the Pandas library to query the dataset and extract relevant information.
- I employed visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative and clear plots that highlight key aspects of the data, particularly transaction types and their relation to fraud.

### 3. Implementation of Functions
- I wrote various functions to handle specific data querying and processing tasks, such as retrieving column names, obtaining specific rows, and filtering transactions based on fraud status.

### 4. Custom Analysis
- I conducted a custom analysis to filter out outliers based on transaction amounts and visualized the relationship between transaction amount and fraud status.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, I gained valuable experience in data manipulation, querying, and visualization, equipping myself with the skills to analyze large datasets and present findings in a clear and accessible manner. The insights I derived from this analysis can be instrumental for improving fraud detection mechanisms and optimizing transaction handling in financial services.

## Code and Visualizations
I provided code that includes a series of functions designed to explore different aspects of the dataset, along with visualization functions to create insightful plots. These visualizations highlight the distribution of transaction types, their association with fraud, and the relationship between transaction amounts and fraud occurrences.
